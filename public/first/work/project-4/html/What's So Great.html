		What's So Great About Web Frameworks?

	<h3>
		Anyone can code!
	</h3>
	<p>
		The great thing about web frameworks is that they allow basically anyone to create websites, applications, etc. because they don't need much coding knowledge. There are tons of options for different applications and purposes. Some languages are tailor-made for certain applications, uses, or purposes. If someone has an idea for a website, all they have to do is fine a framework they like. A framework should be chosen based on what type of website or application they are making, and what format of framework they prefer. There are many sites dedicated to teaching beginners how to set up web framework software and get started using it, so it is not difficult to become comfortable with any one of them. These days, anyone can code.
