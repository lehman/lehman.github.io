	 <h1>About Me</h1>
	 <div id="profilepic"><img src="louise.jpg" alt="Louise Lehman" width="300"></div>
	 <p>Hello! My name is Louise Lehman. Welcome to my page! I am currently a third year Computer Science student at UCLA interested in Media Arts, Graphics, Animation, and Design. My website started as a project for one of my Design | Media Arts classes this year, and will hopefully develop and grow more over time. Start exploring to see what I'm up to, what I've done, and what I hope to accomplish in the future.
	 
	 I'm completing my Science and Technology Elective requirements with classes in the Design and Media Arts school, and my Technical Breadth Electives in the Technology Management category. I aspire to some day work in the entertainment industry making animated movies. Computer graphics in general interest me, but the idea of making something that fully engages imagination and brings joy to kids is also very motivating. One of my favorite things to do is watch movie previews in the theater and, if it doesn't bother my company, I always like to watch all the credits at the end.</p>
	 <br/>
	 <h2>Sailing</h2>
	 <p>Whatever time I don't devote to school work, I devote to the UCLA Sailing Team, of which I've been a member since my freshman year of college. I had never sailed before, and this team has given me a lot of great opportunities to learn, be in great community, get outdoors, and be active. It is definitely one of my favorite things about college and something I'm very proud and lucky to be a part of. We compete in regattas up and down the coast of California and have at least one regatta in Hawaii and one in France every year.</p>
