# Louise Lehman's Personal Website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load a variable Google Font.

## Setup

After cloning, run the following commands to get set up and run locally:

```
npm install
```

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To run the app in production mode, run the following commands to generate an optimized production build and then start the app in production mode:

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Deploying

Run the following command to build the code for deployment. It is set up to deploy to the `build` branch of this repository, and the GitHub Pages site where this is hosted is set up to be built from this branch.

**Note**: This will result in your changes being live on the website when run on any branch, not just `master`.

```
npm run deploy
```
