		What is a web framework for?
	</h3>
	<p>
		Web frameworks were designed to make building a website faster and easier. They provide methods of streamlining the mundane and common tasks in web development. One of the main ways they do this is by promoting the reuse of code. Web frameworks can be made to work in ways that are better for certain end results, but they overarchingly  designed to support development of dynamic websites, web applications, and web services.

		A web framework is a collection of tools made to meet what are known as the common CRUD cases:
			<ul>
				<li>Create</li>
				<li>Read</li>
				<li>Update</li>
				<li>Delete</li>
			</ul>
		These are the main functionalities that websites have to interact with their databases and user input/output.

	<p>
		The way frameworks work are through libraries which provide certain functionalities. Some of these functionalities are:
		<ul>
				<li>accessing a database</li>
				<li>managing sessions and cookies</li>
				<li>creating templates to display your HTML</li>
				<li>promoting the reuse of code</li>
				<li>autheticating users, building an admin backend, all with a few lines of code</li>
				<li>allowing developers to achieve more, with less coding</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>
		Types of Frameworks (How They're Structured)
	</h3>
	<p>
		There are four different types of frameworks. Frameworks are categorized within these types based on how they organize data.
		<ul>
			<li>Model-View-Controller (MVC)</li>
				<ul>
					<li>separate data model with business rules from the user interface</li>
					<li>modularizes code</li>
					<li>promotes code reuse</li>
					<li>allows multiple interfaces to be applied</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Push-Based vs. Pull-Based</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Push Based: do processing then push data to view layer</li>
					<li>Pull Based: start with view layer, pull results from multiple controllers when needed; multiple controllers can be involved with a single view</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Three-Tier Organization</li>
				<ul>
					<li>structured around three physical tiers:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>client</li>
						<li>application</li>
						<li>database</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			<li>Content Management Systems</li>
				<ul>
					<li>ex. Wordpress</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
